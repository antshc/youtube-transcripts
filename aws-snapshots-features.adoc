= AWS EBS Snapshot & AMI Features — Quick Recall Cheat Sheet

== 1. Amazon EBS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) — "Instant Full-Speed Volumes"

=== Problem It Solves
Normally, EBS volumes created from snapshots suffer from lazy-loading. Until blocks are read from S3, performance is degraded.

=== What FSR Does
FSR makes restored EBS volumes fully-initialized immediately, delivering maximum provisioned IOPS and throughput from the first I/O.

=== Key Points
|===
| Feature | Description

| Instant readiness | No warm-up, no I/O penalty
| Full performance | Max IOPS/throughput from the start
| Per-AZ feature | Must be enabled per snapshot per AZ
| Higher cost | You pay hourly for FSR-enabled snapshots
|===

**Use when:** DR restore, production-critical workloads, low-latency boot, rapid failover.


== 2. Time-Based Snapshot & AMI Copy — "Finish Replication Before a Deadline"

=== Problem It Solves
Compliance and business rules requiring that AMIs or snapshots be copied within a specific timeframe (e.g., cross-region within 60 minutes).

=== How It Works
You define a completion duration. AWS then adjusts snapshot throughput dynamically so all snapshots finish before the deadline.

=== Example
|===
| Snapshot | Size (MiB) | Duration | Required Throughput

| Snapshot 1 | 200,000 | 60 min | 55.56 MiB/s
| Snapshot 2 | 500,000 | 60 min | 138.89 MiB/s
| Snapshot 3 | 450,000 | 60 min | 125 MiB/s
|===

=== Why It Matters
* Predictable copy time
* Meets SLA / compliance
* Supports both snapshots and AMIs


== 3. Snapshot Archive Tier — "Cheap Long-Term Storage"

=== Use Case
Store snapshots for years (compliance, retention) at the lowest cost, without requiring fast recovery.

=== Benefits
|===
| Benefit | Description

| Low cost | Up to ~75% cheaper than standard tier
| Long-term retention | Built for multi-year storage
| Same snapshot | Just a different storage tier
|===

=== Trade-Off
* Slower and higher-cost restore
* Not suitable for fast RTO scenarios (DR, HA)


== 4. EBS Direct APIs — "Work with Snapshots Without EC2"

=== Capabilities
|===
| Capability | Description

| Write directly to snapshots | No need to create a volume or EC2 instance
| Read snapshot blocks | Faster verification, selective reads
| Detect incremental changes | Identify changed blocks between snapshots
|===

=== Why It Matters
* Faster backup workflows
* Lower EC2 and storage overhead
* Ideal for backup/restore vendors and automation pipelines


== 5. One-Line Recap (Memory Aid)
|===
| Feature | Think Of It As

| FSR | "Warm from first I/O — instant full performance"
| Time-based Copy | "Copy must finish before deadline"
| Snapshot Archive | "Cheap long-term cold storage"
| EBS Direct APIs | "Snapshots without volumes"
|===


== 6. When to Use What
|===
| Scenario | Best Feature

| Instant DR restore | FSR
| Need SLA-backed copy timing | Time-based Copy
| Long-term retention with lowest cost | Archive Tier
| Efficient incremental backups | EBS Direct APIs
