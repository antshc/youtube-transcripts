== Core Idea
The Spotify model is *not a framework*. It is an *organizational model* designed to enable agility through *culture, trust, autonomy, and rapid learning*. Instead of prescribing rituals or processes, it focuses on *how to structure teams* so they can *adapt fast and deliver value*.

Traditional frameworks define *how you must work*.  
The Spotify model defines *how you can organize so teams choose how to work*.

== Principles (Easy to Recall: AUTONOMY)

|===
|Principle |Meaning |Why It Matters

|*Autonomy over Control*
|Teams choose their own way of working
|Faster decisions and higher ownership

|*Unity with Light Alignment*
|Shared direction, independent execution
|Enables speed without chaos

|*Trust First*
|Assume positive intent and empower teams
|Reduces micromanagement

|*Organize Around Work*
|Structure follows product value, not ceremonies
|Faster customer outcomes

|*No One-Size-Fits-All Process*
|Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban — Squad decides
|Adaptive and context-driven

|*Outcome over Output*
|Measure value, not activity
|Focus on impact

|*Mission Clarity*
|Each Squad has a clear purpose
|Improves motivation and focus

|*Y-Shaped Knowledge*
|Deep specialty + broad awareness
|Improves collaboration

== Organizational Structure

Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds form the core structure. Trios and Alliances provide additional alignment at scale.

=== Squads (Autonomy)
* Cross-functional teams (6–12 people)
* Own a feature or mission
* Choose their own agile method (Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, etc.)
* Supported by an Agile Coach and guided by a Product Owner

=== Tribes (Alignment)
* A collection of Squads working in the same domain
* Typically 40–150 people (Dunbar’s Number)
* Have a Tribe Lead to coordinate across Squads

=== Chapters (Consistency)
* Group of specialists (e.g., DBAs, JavaScript engineers) across Squads
* Ensure technical standards and best practices
* Led by a senior technology lead (often the people manager)

=== Guilds (Knowledge Sharing)
* Voluntary community of interest (e.g., DevOps Guild)
* Cross-Tribe and cross-team
* Informal, no hierarchy, knowledge-sharing driven

=== Trio (3 Lenses, 1 Direction)
* Tribe Lead + Product Lead + Design Lead
* Align business, technology, and UX within a Tribe

=== Alliance (Scaling Beyond One Tribe)
* A group of multiple Trios working toward a larger goal
* Used when multiple Tribes must collaborate for a shared mission

== One-Sentence Memory Cheat
*Squads build, Tribes align, Chapters standardize, Guilds share, Trios steer, Alliances scale.*

== Key Difference vs Traditional Scaling

|===
|Spotify Model |Traditional Scaling Frameworks (e.g., SAFe, LeSS, Scrum@Scale)

|Culture-first
|Process-first

|Autonomy and choice
|Prescribed ceremonies and roles

|Lightweight alignment
|Heavy governance

|Evolves over time
|Standardized and rigid
|===

== Why It Works
* Unlocks innovation
* Reduces bureaucracy
* Creates motivated, accountable teams
* Preserves startup speed at scale

== Why It Fails When Misapplied
* Companies copy the structure without the culture
* Autonomy is granted without trust
* Leaders refuse to shift to servant leadership
