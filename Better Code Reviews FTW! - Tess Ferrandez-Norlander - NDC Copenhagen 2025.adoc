= Better Code Reviews FTW! – Tess Ferrandez-Norlander (NDC Copenhagen 2025)
:toc:
:toclevels: 3

== 1. Executive Summary

Tess Ferrandez-Norlander, a Microsoft developer and data scientist, explores how to make *code reviews more effective, constructive, and human*.  
She challenges the myth that productive reviews require arguments, asserting instead that *great reviews are rooted in feedback, empathy, collaboration, and clarity* — not confrontation.

She frames code reviews not merely as a defect-finding process but as a *vehicle for knowledge sharing, code ownership, mentorship, and collective improvement*.  
Machines can and should catch the mechanical errors; humans should focus on design intent, readability, maintainability, and team learning.

Ferrandez introduces *ten key practices* to improve reviews, including:
- writing reviewable pull requests (PRs),
- settling style arguments with automation,
- prioritizing PR reviews over new work,
- framing comments as questions,
- focusing on main issues first, and
- resolving stalemates quickly through direct communication.

Her talk blends psychological insight and engineering pragmatism, showing how *tone and empathy* directly influence team culture and long-term productivity.  
Effective code reviews, she concludes, make the code better *and* the team stronger.

== 2. Core Theses

=== “If you’re arguing in code reviews, you might be doing them wrong.”
*Conflict and defensiveness reduce effectiveness.*  
Arguments stem from ego, not engineering value. The goal is consensus and clarity, not victory.  
Example: Instead of insisting “my way is better,” ask “Can we try this alternative?” — this fosters collaboration.

=== “Once code is in the repo, it’s not my code — it’s our code.”
*Encourage shared ownership over personal pride.*  
This mindset prevents territorial behavior and encourages collective improvement.  
Example: Developers who treat the repository as shared focus on collective learning, not defending “their” code.

=== “Code reviews are feedback — and feedback is communication.”
Code reviews are *text-only, terse, and mandatory*, which makes tone matter.  
Written comments can easily sound accusatory.  
Example: Instead of “You put this in the wrong class,” write “Can we move this to the user repository for consistency?”

=== “Write PRs you’d want to review.”
Authors should make code easy to read and context clear.  
*Small, focused PRs* are much easier to review.  
Example: Instead of submitting a 2,000-line PR, split it into smaller logical chunks with summaries, test evidence, and reasoning.

=== “Settle style arguments with a style guide.”
Don’t waste human energy on formatting.  
Automate style enforcement using linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks.  
Example: Avoid “tabs vs spaces” debates by using `.editorconfig` or Prettier.

=== “Automate the boring bits.”
Let machines catch trivial issues; let humans review intent and quality.  
Example: Use CI tools to check for typos, code style, and secrets — freeing reviewers to focus on design or security.

=== “Treat PRs as high priority.”
Review promptly. Delayed feedback causes branching chaos and discouragement.  
Rule of thumb: *Before picking new tasks, review open PRs.*

=== “Don’t overwhelm the author.”
Avoid laundry lists of minor issues; focus on the changes that matter most.  
Example: Instead of 20 nitpicks, leave one structured comment like:  
“Refactoring this function per our pattern will fix several smaller issues.”

=== “Don’t chase perfection.”
Ship *good enough* code — perfection can wait.  
Over-polishing burns time and morale. Incremental improvement is more sustainable.  
Example: Approve code that works and is readable; refine later instead of blocking delivery.

=== “Resolve stalemates proactively.”
When disagreements arise, *communicate directly*.  
Talk it out or involve a neutral third reviewer.  
Example: If tone escalates in PR comments, stop typing and have a 5-minute call.

== 3. Easy-Recall Section

=== ✅ Best Practices
- Write clear, small, and self-contained PRs.
- Include test results and reasoning in PR descriptions.
- Automate linting, formatting, and build checks.
- Review PRs before starting new work.
- Praise good patterns explicitly to reinforce them.
- Frame suggestions as questions, not commands.
- Use examples in feedback (`Use F-strings, e.g. f'{var}'`).
- Pick up the phone when tension rises.

=== ❌ Don’ts
- Don’t argue to “win.”
- Don’t leave massive PRs unreviewed.
- Don’t nitpick style inconsistencies manually.
- Don’t write accusatory comments (“You did…”).
- Don’t block merging over minor issues.
- Don’t overwhelm authors with dozens of low-value comments.

=== ⚖️ Rules of Thumb
- *If it compiles but confuses → fix readability.*
- *If it works but isn’t perfect → approve, then improve later.*
- *If tone escalates → switch to voice chat.*
- *If the reviewer and author tie → reviewer wins (fresh eyes rule).*

=== ⚙️ Automation Ideas
- Use Git hooks or CI to enforce formatting.
- Run static analysis, unit tests, and secret detection before review.
- Integrate AI copilots for pre-review suggestions.
- Automatically assign PR reviewers after daily stand-ups.

|===
| Time | Insight

| *00:21–01:27* | Tess introduces herself (Microsoft developer, AI & data science). Notes that arguing in code reviews is *not* a good practice.
| *02:20–03:50* | Code reviews should be more than finding defects — they’re about shared learning, ownership, and patterns.
| *04:00–06:00* | Feedback in PRs is tough: impersonal, text-based, and often overly negative.
| *07:36–10:16* | First principle: *Be open to feedback.* Ask specific questions and respond appreciatively.
| *10:26–11:04* | In a tie, the reviewer wins — they have a fresh perspective.
| *11:06–14:17* | Authors: write PRs you’d want to review — small, clear, tested, and readable.
| *15:02–16:32* | Settle style disputes with style guides; automate enforcement.
| *17:02–18:48* | Automate boring bits (linting, formatting, secret scanning).
| *19:00–20:19* | Treat PRs as highest priority — review before new work.
| *20:56–22:37* | Don’t overwhelm authors; focus on key issues.
| *23:27–24:55* | Respect PR scope; don’t expand it with unrelated changes.
| *24:56–26:31* | Avoid perfectionism. “Good and readable” beats “perfect but late.”
| *27:06–29:36* | Give positive feedback generously to reinforce good behavior.
| *29:39–33:06* | Use examples and questions in feedback; avoid accusatory tone.
| *34:45–36:17* | Handle stalemates via communication, third opinions, or letting it pass.
| *37:26–38:10* | Summary: “If you’re arguing, you might be doing it wrong.”
| *44:47–48:20* | Q&A: commit-level reviews, automation tooling, teaching review culture.
